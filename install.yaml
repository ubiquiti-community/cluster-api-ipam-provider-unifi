                        Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.

                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
